## My Personal Playground ðŸš€  

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository! This is where I explore interesting technologies and experiment with all kinds of creative ideas. Some projects are just for fun, while others might evolve into something more complete over time.  

### ðŸ”¥ Current Projects  
1. **AI Assistant ðŸ¤–**  
   - Built using Deepseek's SDK, this AI assistant helps automate tasks and answer questions.  
2. **Fortune-Telling Website ðŸ”®**  
   - One of my earliest frontend projectsâ€”a simple tool to calculate bone weight for fortune-telling.  
   - I'm planning to refine it into a fully functional, user-friendly website.  

### ðŸŽ¯ Future Plans  
1. **AI-Powered Knowledge Retention & Quiz Platform ðŸ“š**  
   - A smart tool to help users reinforce knowledge through AI-driven question drills.  
2. **Chinese Almanac Website ðŸ“†**  
   - A site that provides behavior guidance based on zodiac signs and traditional fortune-telling principles.  

Stay tuned for updates as I continue building and experimenting! ðŸš€  

If the language above feels a bit stiff, that's because it was generated by ChatGPT. This is also a problem that technology needs to solveâ€”how can we help people with different native languages communicate more efficiently and accurately while building mutual trust?  

If you have any ideas, feel free to reach out! Iâ€™m a chatterbox with a wild imagination. ðŸš€

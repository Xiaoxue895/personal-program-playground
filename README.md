The author of the "Weighing the Bones" fortune-telling method is Yuan Tiangang, an astronomer from the Tang Dynasty. 

It calculates a person's fate based on the weight derived from their birth year, month, day, and time. 

The principle behind it seems to suggest that a person's life is ever-changing, with new developments every day, but within this change, there are consistent patterns, as the essence remains the same.
